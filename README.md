# Disclaimer

This project is just a fun experiment and not intended for widespread use. It’s a basic URL shortener that you can play around with locally, but don’t expect a polished product! Feel free to explore the code and tinker with it if you like, but keep in mind that it’s not intended to be a fully-featured application.

## Features to think about
